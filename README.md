# comfyui-hydit
The ComfyUI code is under review in the official repository. Meanwhile, a temporary version is available below for immediate community use.
We welcome users to try our workflow and appreciate any inquiries or suggestions.


## Overview
- Support two workflows: Standard ComfyUI and Diffusers Wrapper, with the former being recommended.
- Support HunyuanDiT-v1.1 and v1.2.
- Support module, lora and clip lora models trained by Kohya.
- Support module, lora models trained by HunyunDiT official training scripts.
- ControlNet is coming soon.

### Standard Workflow (Recommended)

## Usage
### Dependencies

1. Official ComfyUI Environment Setup
```shell
# Please use python 3.10 version with cuda 11.7
conda create --name comfyui-hydit python=3.10
conda activate comfyui-hydit

# Download comfyui code
git clone https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI.git
cd ${ComfyUI}
git reset --hard 90389b3b8a69c08c3ed0bcc9d87a92246578a8e3

# Install torch, torchvision, torchaudio
pip install torch==2.0.1 torchvision==0.15.2 torchaudio==2.0.2 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu117 --default-timeout=100 future

# Install Comfyui essential python package
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. HunyuanDiT Environment Setup in ComfyUI
```shell
# Move to the ComfyUI custom_nodes folder and copy comfyui-hydit folder from HunyuanDiT Repo.
cd ${ComfyUI}/custom_nodes
git clone https://github.com/Tencent/HunyuanDiT.git
cp -r HunyuanDiT/comfyui-hydit ./
rm -rf HunyuanDiT
cd ${ComfyUI}/custom_nodes/comfyui-hydit

```

3. (Optional) Deployment on Windows environment
```shell
cd ${ComfyUI}/custom_nodes
git clone https://github.com/Tencent/HunyuanDiT.git
xcopy /E /I HunyuanDiT\comfyui-hydit comfyui-hydit
rmdir /S /Q HunyuanDiT
cd ${ComfyUI}/custom_nodes/comfyui-hydit

4. Running ComfyUI successfully
```shell
# Go to ComfyUI main folder
cd ${ComfyUI}
# Run the ComfyUI Lauch command
python main.py --listen --port 80
```

### Standard workflow (Recommended)

1. Preparing Model Weights

Use the command below to download the file to the specified folder. If already downloaded, create a symbolic link to that folder.
```shell
# clip encoder
wget -O ${ComfyUI}/models/clip/pytorch_model.bin https://huggingface.co/Tencent-Hunyuan/HunyuanDiT-v1.2/blob/main/t2i/clip_text_encoder/pytorch_model.bin
# mt5
mkdir ${ComfyUI}/models/t5
wget -O ${ComfyUI}/models/t5/pytorch_model.bin https://huggingface.co/Tencent-Hunyuan/HunyuanDiT-v1.2/blob/main/t2i/mt5/pytorch_model.bin
# vae
wget -O ${ComfyUI}/models/vae/diffusion_pytorch_model.bin https://huggingface.co/Tencent-Hunyuan/HunyuanDiT-v1.2/blob/main/t2i/sdxl-vae-fp16-fix/diffusion_pytorch_model.bin
# base model
wget -O ${ComfyUI}/models/checkpoints/pytorch_model_ema.pt https://huggingface.co/Tencent-Hunyuan/HunyuanDiT-v1.2/blob/main/t2i/model/pytorch_model_ema.pt
```
Put module weights trained through Kohya or the official script in `${ComfyUI}/models/checkpoints/` to switch model weights in ComfyUI.

2. Preparing LoRa Weights

```shell
# Put LoRa weights trained by Kohya in ComfyUI/models/loras
cp ${HunyuanDiT}/kohya_ss/outputs/last-step{xxxx}.safetensors ${ComfyUI}/models/loras

# (Optional) Put LoRa weights trained by official scripts in ComfyUI/models/loras
python convert_hunyuan_to_coimfyui_lora.py \
      --lora_path ${HunyuanDiT}/log_EXP/001-lora_porcelain_ema_rank64/checkpoints/0000100.pt/adapter_model.safetensors \
      --save_lora_path ${ComfyUI}/models/loras/adapter_model_convert.safetensors

# update the `lora.py` file
cp ${ComfyUI}/custom_nodes/comfyui-hydit/lora.py ${ComfyUI}/comfy/lora.py
```

### Diffusers Wrapper
1. Preparing Model Weights

```shell
python -m pip install "huggingface_hub[cli]"
mkdir models/hunyuan
huggingface-cli download Tencent-Hunyuan/HunyuanDiT-v1.2 --local-dir ./models/hunyuan/ckpts
huggingface-cli download Tencent-Hunyuan/HunyuanDiT-v1.2 t2i/model/pytorch_model_ema.pt --local-dir ./models/hunyuan/ckpts/t2i/model
```

2. Preparing LoRa Weights

```shell
# Put LoRa weights trained by Kohya in ComfyUI/models/loras
cp ${HunyuanDiT}/kohya_ss/outputs/adapter_model.safetensors ${ComfyUI}/models/loras

# (Optional) Put LoRa weights trained by official scripts in ComfyUI/models/loras
# The PEFT diffuser format needs to be converted into the standard ComfyUI format
python convert_hunyuan_to_coimfyui_lora.py \
      --lora_path ${HunyuanDiT}/log_EXP/001-lora_porcelain_ema_rank64/checkpoints/0000100.pt/adapter_model.safetensors \
      --save_lora_path ${ComfyUI}/models/loras/adapter_model_convert.safetensors

# update the `lora.py` file
cp ${ComfyUI}/custom_nodes/comfyui-hydit/lora.py ${ComfyUI}/comfy/lora.py
```
